# Digital Crafts March Cohort
The prupose of this repo is to have a working examples of the lectures we covered in class. That can be used as references and study material. 

## [Bootstrap](https://hackmd.io/@XinhdUgJSt2kHuiYLatSqQ/H1fefod79#/)
Bootstrap allows you to build resposive web sites fast. Useful for prototyping and quckily coming up with design that fit the overall raodmap to any projec.t 
## [DOM](https://hackmd.io/@XinhdUgJSt2kHuiYLatSqQ/By9uQDJV5#/)
The Document object model is the browsers way of object-izing our html code. Paring the document object with our javscript code give us the ability to handle event on the page as well rendering new elements dynamically. 
## [Form Validaton](https://hackmd.io/@XinhdUgJSt2kHuiYLatSqQ/H15RN7JB5)
The best user experiences on any web page has some sort of from validation whether it is done as part of the UI or in background. Utilizing form validation or just validations in general gives us an extra layer of securty. This ensures that we capture the right data and that our users are using the site as intended.  
## [jQuery](https://hackmd.io/@XinhdUgJSt2kHuiYLatSqQ/HkepZtVSc)
Our first library. Jquery is a library that was used to combine functionalities across multiple browsers. When the internet was at its earliest stages differnet browsers had different ways of accessing elemnts, handling events, and passing around dynamic data via ajax. Jquery's goal was to simplify that and give methods that allow developers to code for multiple browsers.
## [Asynchrnonous Coding](https://hackmd.io/@XinhdUgJSt2kHuiYLatSqQ/S1I8EuDB5)
Async coding allows us to inject data from external sorurces, utilize dynamic data, and customize our code so that a single threaded language like javascript essentially can perform more that one task at time. `setTimeout()` is async code at it's simplest form. Retrieving data across the internet takes time to process and understanding how we can add this to our code is the crux of engineering. 
### Promise Diagram: 
A promise is an object that represents a peice of data that will eventually arrive from an asychronus action. See diagram to understand the path of our data when we utilize promises.
